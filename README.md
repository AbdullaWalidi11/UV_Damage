# UV Damage Assessment Project

This project implements a modular, AI-based system for assessing UV damage including hyperpigmentation, wrinkles, and redness.

## Structure

- `data/`: Dataset storage (raw/processed)
- `models/`: Trained model weights
- `modules/`: Core logic for analysis components
- `utils/`: Helper functions
- `notebooks/`: Exploration and experiments
- `main.py`: Entry point

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate it.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
